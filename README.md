This repository is a project to see if it is feasible to model how religions grow using SIR models. We begin by deriving the model used, 
listing simplifying assumptions and proving local existence and uniquness as well as global existence of our solutions. 
We discuss interesting results such as parasitic religious growth and religious wars and ending with possible work to be researched in the future.
